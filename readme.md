Project Implementation.
Components:
1) MVVM Architecture
2) Used Repository Pattern for data access between Retrofit and ViewModel
3) Used LiveData for observing data into the view.
4) Unit testing done with Junit and Mockito

Further Improvements:
1) Stretched Goal: to mark favourite item with the help of Room Library
2) Could be improved to clean code architecture with separate data, domain and presentation layer
